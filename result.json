There are almost 80 other libdns repos that rely on libdns/libdns, the most popular of which is libdns/cloudflare. It is used by Caddy through caddyserver/certmagic, which uses caddy-dns/cloudflare when you plug it in. ALL of these repos have been updated by me to support the breaking changes.\n> \n> `xcaddy` is also working as expected, as is the `go` command.\n> \n> The problem is that when you build with xcaddy, you're creating a new `go.mod` -- i.e. a new listing of which dependencies and their versions to use. If you're building the latest Caddy tag, which is not compatible with the breaking changes, but then the latest commit on the caddy-dns/cloudflare package, which DOES have the breaking changes, then it'll break your build. So you have to choose versions that are compatible.\n\nOk thanks - this makes sense.
